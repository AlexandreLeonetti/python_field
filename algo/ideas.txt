# buy at the open with basic stop loss one ATR ( or similar) away from the open.
#  if not stopped out, sell a the close. no matter what.
# test it on a blind back test on BTC-LTC and BTC-EOS pair


# 1 clean the LTC-BTC python program. and then calculate returns by myself.
# then try different time periods and different stop losses.
# calculate delta and average of all Highs-Opens on the pair. that will give a descent ide of where to place stop loss

once all of this is done. try on different time frames.
and then add a basic Moving Average condition.
